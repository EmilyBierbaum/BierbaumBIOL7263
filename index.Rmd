### **About myself**
My name is Emily Bierbaum, and I am starting my 3rd year as a PhD students in Dr. Bonett's lab studying salamanders. Outside of school, I enjoy playing soccer and going herping.

### **Research Experience**
I began my academic career as a double major student in biology and animal ecology at Iowa State University studying the population dynamics of leopard frogs. I then attended Southeastern Louisiana University and completed my master's degree researching the homology of mesopodial skeletal elements and digit number in salamanders, and the comparison to amphiumid salamanders. I am now a PhD student at the University of Tulsa evaluating visual pigments across salamanders, with a focus on the genus *Eurycea*.
